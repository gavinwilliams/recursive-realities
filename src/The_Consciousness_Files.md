## About This Collection

**The Consciousness Files** is an open-source anthology that blends speculative fiction, philosophy, and modern science. Each story examines the blurry boundary between consciousness and code, creator and creation, matter and meaning.

These stories aren't sequels—they're *resonances.* Each explores a different facet of existence through the lenses of:
- **Quantum and string theory**
- **Artificial intelligence and simulated worlds**
- **Death, perception, and rebirth**
- **The recursive nature of creation itself**

> *Reality might just be a vibration, and we're the song interpreting itself.*
